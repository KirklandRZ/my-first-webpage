        <p>I don't remember the age i was when i went to Florida and Disney World but it was my first time flying on an airplane and when we got there we stayed at the sports resort it was awesome i got to get a smashed penny with goofy on it, i was too afraid to go on the rides but i still enjoyed it! Epcot was my favorite part of that trip. </p>
